## About Me
Hello! Iâ€™m Golam. I'm a first-year PhD student at the University of Kentucky in the veterinary science graduate program, specifically in microbiology and infectious diseases. As an undergraduate, I studied veterinary medicine at BSMRAU, Bangladesh, and worked in a lab studying genomic characterization of mastitis-causing pathogens. At UK, I'm currently investigating the interactions between bacterial pathogens and antimicrobial resistance patterns in food-producing animals.
